Hi! This is Muhammad Shafi, This repository is specifically created for the connection of the database which is on MySQL. 
we made this connection using Python to connect an HTML file with Python. we also used XAMP here.
so paste html file in the htdocs folder and you can paste the python file anywhere in the system.
1. open the terminal: pip install Mysql, it installs 
2. in the terminal go to the directory where the Python file exists
3. type (python example.py) in the terminal
4. open the browser type localhost:8000/form.html ----form.html is the html file name
